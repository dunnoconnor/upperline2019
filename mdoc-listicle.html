                  <p class="text-justify">Mouse Guard is unusual in both setting and structure.  Based on graphic novels by David Petersen, the game focuses a pseudo-feudal order of intelligent mice going on perilous missions.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">A game about criminals in a haunted city.  The focus on heists supports a great structure, but it's the flashback system that stands out for it's innovation. Players can describe how they prepared for a score off-screen and pay a resource to make it happen.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">The King is dead is described as an "RPG Party Game".  There is no prep, no GM, and players start scenes by choosing them from a book.  It is far afield from the rpg mainstream, and very much worth trying.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">The Quiet Year is another GMless game, but rather than being full of character dialogue, it has almost none.  The game is focused on drawing a map, and updating it to reflect events drawn from a deck of cards.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">Follow has perhaps the lightest touch of rules of any game I've played.  It is about a group on a perilous quest (like the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings) but has no specific setting.  The game is about how the members of this quest attempt to complete it, and what they lose along the way.</p>
